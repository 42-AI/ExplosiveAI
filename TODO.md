# TODO - Ideas, Comments & Errors

## Maybe Errors to check

- Environment.do_action & get_state docstring may be innacurate now ?

## Improvements & Ideas

- Add a Ready method to the agent
- Add a Controller type connection (to start, reset and monitor winners)
- Add Passwords for the competition (and remove the players ability to reset the game)
- Add bomb timers in state
- Add connection timeout for players for competition
- Add points on bonus pickup to tiebreak the game after time limit and avoid infinite games

## Known bugs

- The explosion sometimes clips the player on the left of it ! (maybe scale down the explosion)
- Player List on reset or at death

## PRIORITIES

- RESET FIX
- READY
- EXPORT UNITY PROJECT
